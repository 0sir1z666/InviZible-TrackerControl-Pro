# Invizible Tracker Control Pro

Invizible Tracker Control Pro is an open-source Android privacy project
that aims to unify:

- TrackerControl-style per-app tracker blocking
- DNSCrypt
- Tor
- I2P

## Philosophy
- Single VPNService
- No tracker inspection of Tor/I2P/DNSCrypt
- Per-app policy control
- Privacy by design, no telemetry

## Status
⚠️ Early-stage architecture & skeleton.
Not production-ready.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome:
- VPN routing logic
- Tracker detection
- Tor / DNSCrypt / I2P integration
- UI improvements
- Security reviews

## License
TBD (suggested: GPLv3 or AGPLv3)
